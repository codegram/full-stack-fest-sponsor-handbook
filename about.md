## What's Full Stack Fest

Full Stack Fest is an international developer event in Barcelona held over a week, divided in two two-day single-track conferences: backend and frontend, plus a gap day in between to relax and keep the audience's mind fresh.

We're putting the languages aside to put a strong focus on the technologies behind them and the problems they're trying to solve. At its core, the conference retains its soul: A single-track, curated, deeply technical event featuring the best speakers and industry leaders worldwide.

## The organisers

[Codegram](https://www.codegram.com) is a software studio specializing in Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript and Clojure applications, crafted with love in Barcelona and London since 2009.

We’ve been successfully organising conferences since 2012: four editions of Barcelona Ruby Conference (establishing it as one of the main Ruby events in Europe), two editions of Future JS, and three editions of Full Stack Fest.

But we’re not just a bunch of passionate developers: we also have an outstanding specialized media and production crew working with us making sure all aspects of the conference are taken care of in the most professional way. In total, it amounts to more than 25 people that we’re proud to consider our friends.
