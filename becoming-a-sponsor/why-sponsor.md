# Why sponsor

Broadly there are two reasons why our sponsors have trusted our event in the
past, depending on what they are looking for.

Some of them are *looking for brand exposure*, sometimes simply to make their
brands known among developers, some other times to market their products
directly to them. This might be you if you're looking to:

* Give your product visibility and increase its **popularity**
* Get **recognition** and **good vibe** for making Full Stack Fest possible
* Connect your brand with the **values** Full Stack Fest is based on - transparency, openness, individual-oriented
* Show your brandâ€™s compromise with the **future of the industry**

Another major category of sponsors that work with us are companies who are
*looking to attract the best developers*. By showcasing their career
opportunities directly to some of the best worldwide talent, their hiring pools
widen considerably and they have a chance to talk face to face with developers
who are looking for their next challenge. In short, this might be you if you're
looking to:

* **Reach out** to top notch developers of the whole technology stack: Frontend, backend and, of course, full stack.
* **Attract** the best **talent** to take your company to the next level.

Finally, if you're looking to send your team to the conference, sponsoring may
be beneficial to get a *discount on all the tickets*!
