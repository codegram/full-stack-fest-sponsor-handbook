## What's Full Stack Fest

Full Stack Fest is a 3-day, language-agnostic conference for curious developers that want to gaze into the future. Developed to be the ultimate conference retreat for teams looking for inspiration.

We're putting the languages aside to put a strong focus on the technologies behind them and the problems they're trying to solve. At its core, the conference retains its soul: a single-track, curated, deeply technical event featuring the best speakers and industry leaders worldwide.

## Audience

Our audience is interested in a broad range of programming languages and technologies like: Ruby, JavaScript, Performance, Functional Programming, ReactJS, Scalability, Docker, Infrastructure, Internet of Things, Single Page Applications, Go, Rust, Elixir, iOS…

* Most of them consider them advanced or experts
* Mostly developers and technical leads
* In the 25-44 age range
* From Europe
* Curious, looking to get inspired
* Interested in many different programming languages, infrastrucutre, new technologies, scalability or new programming paradigms
