## What's Full Stack Fest

Full Stack Fest is a 3-day, language-agnostic conference for curious developers that want to gaze into the future. It's designed to be the ultimate conference retreat for teams looking for inspiration.

We're putting the languages aside to shine a spotlight on the technologies behind them and the problems we are all trying to solve. At its core, the conference retains its soul: a single-track, curated, deeply technical event featuring the best speakers and industry leaders worldwide.

## Audience

Our audience is interested in a broad range of programming languages and technologies like: Ruby, JavaScript, Performance, Functional Programming, ReactJS, Scalability, Docker, Infrastructure, Internet of Things, Single Page Applications, Go, Rust, Elixir, iOS…
