## Want something more?

We like to think of every relationship with a sponsor as a unique one and as such having specific characteristics. We offer addons - extra perks for the main sponsors packages, so we can build a personalized one that fits your needs with some extra presence in certain parts of the conference.

**Note**: These addons are tied to one of the previously described sponsorship levels.

| **Parties**<br />Our conferences are known for their quality, not only during the talks but also when it’s time to party. Previous parties have been held at Razzmatazz, Otto Zutz (two of the biggest clubs in Barcelona) and also at the beach. The sponsor logo will be present at communications related to the party and also printed on glasses provided to the attendees. The sponsor is also encouraged to provide any other material (like rollups) and to suggest special activities to entertain the audience. |      4       | **2.500€** |
