## Want something more?

We like to think of every relationship with a sponsor as a unique one and as such having specific characteristics. We offer addons - extra perks for the main sponsors packages, so we can build a personalized one that fits your needs with some extra presence in certain parts of the conference.

**Note**: These addons are tied to one of the previously described sponsorship levels.
