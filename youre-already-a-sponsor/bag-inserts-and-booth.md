# Bag inserts & booth

Would you like to include something in the tote bags given to each of the attendees? 

If so, we’d need that material at least 2 weeks before the conference. 

Remember: we include a pen, a tshirt, a lanyard and a notebook of the conference inside the totebag.   


Regarding the material you’ll use in your stand, we recommend that you to ship everything directly to the venue’s address, so we have it all there ready to set up.
