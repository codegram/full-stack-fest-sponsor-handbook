# Bag inserts & booth

Would you like to include something in the tote bags we give off to the attendees? 

If so, we’d need that material max. 2 weeks before the conference. 

Remember: we include a pen, a tshirt, a lanyard and a notebook of the conference inside the totebag.   


Regarding the material you’ll use in your stand, we recommend you to ship it directly to the venue’s address so we have it all there ready to set.
