# Bag Inserts & Exhibit Booth

Would you like to include something in the tote bags given to each of the attendees? 

If so, we’d need that material at least 2 weeks before the conference. 

Remember: we include a FSF-branded pen, a tshirt, a lanyard and a notebook inside the totebag, so it's probably best to check in with us about what you'd like to include so we can ensure that not every sponsor adds a notebook, or a pen or any other similar attendee treats. 

Also, keep in mind that paper fliers tend to end up in the trash, so if you decide to include them, please limit them to A5 size tops.

Get in touch if you need any clarity regarding the items you're considering to include :)

Regarding the material you’ll use in your stand, we recommend that you to ship everything directly to the venue’s address, so we have it all there ready to set up.
