# Logo Formats & Media

All logos have to be in **vector format** \(.ai or .svg\) or if it's not possible, in .png format. If we need to add your logo to printed media, it has to be **only in vector format** and in **single color** otherwise it can't be printed.

All media files need the **highest resolution**.
