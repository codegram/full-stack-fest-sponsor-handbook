# Engagement opportunities

We're open to any ideas which allow Sponsors to engage with the audience in a more meaningful way, a few general concepts include: 

* Organising a workshop
* Creating a challenge or competition for attendees to engage in and potentially win a prize 
* Set up a Sponsor-themed zone within the conference hall, for example a chill & relax zone

Get in touch with us to discuss any unique ideas or enagagement proposals you have in mind.
