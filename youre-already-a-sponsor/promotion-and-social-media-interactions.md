# Promotion and social media interactions

Once onboard, we'll need your PR Media which we'll publish via our website leading up to the conference, including:

1. All content copies (incl. tweets etc) that you'd like us to publish on your behalf leading up to the event.

2. Sponsors logo for the web, ideally in vector format (SVG, AI, EPS), alternatively a high quality PNG should do the trick.

3. A short company description for the sponsors page (one or two paragraphs at most).
